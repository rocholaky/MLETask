# MLETask

Welcome to the MLETask Package repository! This repository contains a Python package specifically designed to tackle the famous Titanic dataset. The goal of this package is to provide a comprehensive solution for training and evaluating machine learning models on the Titanic dataset, facilitating the exploration of passenger demographics and predicting their survival probabilities.

## About the Titanic Dataset

The Titanic dataset is a well-known and widely used dataset in the field of data analysis and machine learning. It comprises information about passengers who were aboard the RMS Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage in 1912. The dataset offers a rich variety of features, including passenger attributes such as age, gender, class, and family relationships. The most crucial feature, "Survived," determines whether a passenger survived the tragic maritime disaster.

## Purpose of the Package

The main purpose of this package is to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for ML engineers, data scientists to explore, analyze, and build predictive models on the Titanic dataset. The package is built with object-oriented programming principles and adheres to best coding practices, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.

## Features and Capabilities

The Titanic ML Package offers the following key features:

- **API For survivors:** 

- **Model Training and Evaluation:** The package provides a streamlined workflow for training machine learning models on the Titanic dataset. Users can experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters The package also includes evaluation the Accuracy, precision, recall and F1Score metric.
